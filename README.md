# MRes-project
The goal of the proposed project is to optimise the recently developed 2D partial covariance mass spectrometry (see T. Driver et al., PRX 10, 041004 (2020); Physics Today, DOI:10.1063/PT.6.1.20201023a). This will be achieved by formulation of the optimal self correcting partial covariance mapping using machine learning (ML).
